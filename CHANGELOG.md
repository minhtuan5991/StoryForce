# Changelog

## 3.1.3 — 2026-09-28

- Browser Bridge 1.1.8 recognizes ChatGPT's current search-unit and assistant Markdown renderer, including response identity across virtualized turns.
- Recover original JSON escapes through the matching response's Copy action when rendered Markdown is not valid JSON; restore clipboard methods immediately afterward without reading the user's clipboard.
- Bound stalled tab reads and reconnect within the existing collection deadline, without sending the prompt again.
- Resume one legacy collection pause after upgrading the renderer; accepted results still close only their dedicated, unchanged provider tab.
- Log whether a result arrived from automatic collection or a manual action to make future diagnostics verifiable.
- Existing workflows and settings are unchanged. Reload Browser Bridge after installation.

## 3.1.2 — 2026-09-28

- Browser Bridge 1.1.7 recognizes additional ChatGPT composers, including Vietnamese inputs and rich text editors without the previous element ID.
- Continue collecting slow replies within a bounded 15-minute window instead of stopping after three minutes; recover an already-sent legacy timeout by polling only.
- Read all blocks of the latest assistant message and use message identity when rendered message counts stay unchanged.
- Bounded recovery reconnects pre-send tasks after delayed editor loading or a closed message channel, preserving user drafts and single-send authorization.
- Verify the filled prompt before sending; keep existing project settings and workflows.
- Reload the unpacked Browser Bridge extension after installing this update.
